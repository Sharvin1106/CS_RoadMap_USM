# CS_RoadMap_USM

<p> Welcome onboard amigos </p>

<h2> Year 1 </h2>

<p> In your 1st year, you will be learning basic concepts of programming mostly, functional programming and object-oriented in your second semester.  You will get exposure to C++ and Python languages. </p>

<h3> Roadmap </h3>
<h4> Semester 1 </h4>

> Gaddis Book is your holy bible, do as many exercises as you can from that book. It will be helpful to master your programming concepts.

> This point may be irrelevant, but do spend some time to prepare for your university subjects as well.

<h4> Semester 2 </h4>

 
> For this semester you will be exposed to Python, C++ Object Oriented and Data Structures.

> You will use libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy and Pandas --> Focused more towards Data Analytics(basics).
> [Python Introductory Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc&t=393s)
> Matplotlib Resources
> - [Matplotlib Cheatsheet](https://github.com/matplotlib/cheatsheets)
> Pandas Resources
> - [Pandas Cheatsheet](https://pandas.pydata.org/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)
> - [Pandas Cheatsheet 2](https://pydatascience.org/data-science-cheatsheets/)

<h2> Year 2 </h2>

<p> All this while, you would have felt little boring learning concepts. You don't feel challenged enough, here comes your 2nd-year syllabus to spice up your journey.
	
<h3> Roadmap </h3>
<h4> Semester 1 </h4>

<h5> CAT201 </h5>

> You will need to build a web application and also a final project
>> #### Web Application
>> - Learn basic HTML tags (Button tags, HTML forms and etc)
>> - Learn basic CSS (flexbox, fonts, internal, external and inline styling) 
>> - You can add on Javascript to your frontend to make it interactive (take note during my year mark was not given to Javascript however still it makes your website look good and also serves as yr portfolio) --> Focus more on DOM property
>> - Learn PHP for server-side - Basically you should know how to handle POST and GET request

>> #### Java Application - (Mobile/ Desktop App)
>> - Learn Java
>> - You can make use of Firebase for your serverless architecture such as Database, Authentication, Push Notifications - Firebase is easy to integrate with Java 
>> - Very important at least make an app that can make use of database and several things he thought in class
>> - Familiarize with git controls, recommended use GitHub. For more professional use case can try using Azure Devops(which you will be given access in CSE241 class) or Bitbucket.

<h5>Optional</h5>
<p> During your semester break, try to improvise on the projects you have built. Try reimplementing your web application with new web technologies and frameworks. Also, use it for your mobile application for Java Project. Try to make it cross-platform. (This will prepare you for your internship or final project ahead of time)  </p>

Tech you can learn (optional):
1. [Bootstrap](https://hackerthemes.com/bootstrap-cheatsheet/) / TailwindCSS
2. Learn any web frameworks (Advanced)

<h5>CMT221</h5>

> If you are planning to major in AI, try to master in SQL because at some point in Data Science Life-Cycle you have to deal with structured data that requires the knowledge of SQL (Eg. PostgreSQL to maintain a data warehouse)

> Apart from it, do pay more attention to lab sessions, as it will really help you to complete your final project in Oracle Apex.

> Familiarise with DDL, DML, procedure and triggers

<h4> Semester 2 </h4>

<h5> CPC251 </h5>
> This course is comprised of two parts. Machine learning and Deep Learning

> For machine learning you will be using python

> For deep learning you will be using Matlab

> Libraries used: Scikit, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, PyTorch

> I strongly encourage you to pickup tensorflow as its way easier than PyTorch in terms of production deployment. Also have vast amount of community support
