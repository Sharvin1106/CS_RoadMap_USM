# CS_RoadMap_USM

<h1> CS Roadmap USM </h1>

<p> Welcome onboard amigos </p>

<h2> Year 1 </h2>

<p> In year 1 you will be learning basic concepts of programming mostly functional programming in your first semester and object-oriented in your second semester. You will be exposed to C++ and Python language </p>

<h3> Roadmap </h3>
<h4> Semester 1 </h4>

> Gaddis Book is your holy bible, do as many exercises you can from that book. As it will be really helpful to master your programming concepts

> Complete the lab exercises beforehand you attend lab sessions

> This is not relevant but do spend some time preparing for your university subjects as well

<h4> Semester 2 </h4>

 
> This semester you will be exposed to Python, C++ Object Oriented and Data Structures

> You will use libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy and Pandas --> Focused more on Data Anaytics(basics)

<h2> Year 2 </h2>

<p> Maybe you would have felt a little boring learning concepts and does not feel any challenging. There comes year 2 to spice up your Year 2 journey.
	
<h3> Roadmap </h3>
<h4> Semester 1 </h4>

<h5> CAT201 </h5>

> You will need to build a web application and also a final project
>> #### Web Application
>> - Learn basic HTML tags (Button tags, HTML forms and etc)
>> - Learn basic CSS (flexbox, fonts, internal, external and inline styling) 
>> - You can add on Javascript to your frontend to make it interactive (take note during my year mark was not given to Javascript but still it makes your website wowww and also serves as yr portfolio) --> Focus more on DOM property
>> - Learn PHP for server-side - Basically you should know how to handle POST and GET request

>> #### Java Application - (Mobile/ Desktop App)
>> - Learn Java
>> - You can make use of Firebase for your serverless architecture such as Database, Authentication, Push Notifications - Firebase is easy to integrate with Java 
>> - Very important at least make an app that can make use of database and several things he thought in class
>> - Familiarize with git controls, recommended use GitHub. For more professional use case can try using Azure Devops(which you will be given access in CSE241 class) or Bitbucket.

<h5>Optional</h5>
<p> During your semester break try to improvise the projects you have built such as try reimplementing your web application with new web technologies and framework. Also if you create a mobile application for Java Project. Try to make it cross platform. (This will prepare you for your internship or final project ahead of time) </p>

Tech you can learn (optional):
1. Bootstrap / TailwindCSS
2. Learn any web frameworks (Advanced)

<h5>CMT221</h5>

> If you are planning to major in AI, try to master in SQL because at some point in Data Science LifeCycle you have to deal with structured data which requires the knowledge of SQL (Eg. postgressql to maintain data warehouse)

> Apart from it do pay more attention in lab sessions, as it will really help you to complete your final project in Oracle Apex.

> Familiariase with DDL, DML, procedure and triggers

<h4> Semester 2 </h4>

<h5> CPC251 </h5>
> This course comprised of two parts. Machine learning and Deep Learning

> For machine learning you will be using python

> For deep learning you will be using Matlab

> Libraries used: Scikit, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, PyTorch

> I strongly encourage to pickup tensorflow as its far better than PyTorch in terms of production deployment. Also have vast amount of community support
